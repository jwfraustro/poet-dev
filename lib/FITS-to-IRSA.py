             M. Oliver Bowman, Matthew Hardin, and Thomas J. Loredo\n \
             which was published in 2011 in ApJ.\n \
             The data are from the Infrared Array Camera and the Infrared\n \
             Spectrograph''s photometric blue peak-up array on the US National\n \
             Aeronautics and Space Administrations Spitzer Space Telescope,\n \

             The paper cited above and its electronic supplement, of which this\n \
             file is a part, describe the observations and data analysis.\n \
             The data below are in IPAC table format. The keywords describe the\n \
             columns in the table. All series (pixel position, frame number,\n \
             etc.) are zero-based. Data in a table row are valid if GOOD equals 1,\n \
             invalid otherwise. ORIGIN originally read "Spitzer Science Center",\n \
             but has been updated to reflect the origin of the present file.'
