  Description:
  ------------
  Routines for creating PSF (from a supersampled PSF) and fitting of
  PSF images to data images. There are two functions to make a PSF,
  either interpolating or binning down from a supersampled PSF.

  Package Contents:
  -----------------
  
  There are two main types of routines: 'constructors' to make a PSF
  image, and 'PSF fitting' routines to fit a PSF to data. The package
  also contains 'wrappers' to easy implement in Spitzer data, and
  other subroutines.
  
  PSF Constructors:
  - make_psf_interp:  Makes a PSF image by shifting, rescaling, and
                      setting the stellar and sky fluxes of a super
                      sampled PSF.
                      
  - make_psf_binning: Makes a PSF image by binning down a super sampled
                      PSF. Sets then the stellar and sky fluxes.
  
  PSF Fitting:
  - psf_fit: Fits a supersampled PSF to a data image. The position is
             fitted at discrete positions while the stellar and sky
             fluxes are fitted with scipy's leastsq function.

  Spitzer Wrapper:
  - spitzer_fit:  Routine wrapper for easy plug-in into POET pipeline.
                  Fits a PSF in a data frame from Spitzer.

  Subroutines:
  - binarray:  Resamples a 2D image by stacking and adding every bin
               of pixels along each dimension.

  - residuals: Calculates the residuals of a weighted, stellar flux +
               sky background fit of a model to data.

  - gradient: Calculates the gradient of the parameters in residuals.

    Notes:
    ------
    make_psf_binning works under the premise that the supersampled PSF
    is sampled fine enough that differences less than a supersampled
    pixel is undistinguishable. Then the sPSF can be shifted
    in units of subpixels only.

    Note also the input parameter 'param' is different than in
    make_psf_interp.

def residuals(params, data, model, weights):
  """
    Calculates the residuals of a weighted, stellar flux + sky
    background fit of a model to data.

    Parameters:
    -----------
    params : 2-element tuple  [flux, sky]
             The model parameters to fit. Flux is the scaling factor,
             while sky is a constant background.
    data : 1D ndarray
           An array with the data values.
    model : 1D ndarray
            Same shape as data, this array contains the stellar model.
    weights : ndarray
              Same shape as data, this array contains weighting
              factors to ponderate the fit. Usually corresponds to:
              weights = 1/standard deviation.

    Result:
    -------
    This routine return a 1D ndarray with the weighted differences
    between the model and the data.
